# ReAnimate-0.0.1
How to download?:
Download the folder, then extract it. Run start.bat
When I try to run start.bat, Windows Defender SmartScreen protected my PC from running the .bat file:
Press "More info" then press "Run anyway".
Is my character XMLs in the folder?:
Yes! Here's the file location: "ReAnimate-master/GoAnimate-Wrapper-master/GoAnimate-Wrapper-master/_CACHÃ‰" then you can see your character XMLs!
